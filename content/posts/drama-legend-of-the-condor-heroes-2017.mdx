这段时间由于疫情在家办公，home office不同于严肃的办公楼，在没开会的时候总是少不了一些骚柔的背景音乐，听得多了各大平台的AI就会在背后为你忙活，一日Youtube推送了一曲桃源三生，这虽是一首曲词优美的中国风歌曲，但起初并未在意，直到无意间望一眼MV画面，这一暼堪称惊鸿，如道闪电一般直击内心，
将我心中尘封多年的武侠世界唤醒，清晰的还原到眼前，让我在那么一瞬间无法分辨是真是幻，只见画面中一白衣少女，头发上束了条金色细带，在阳光下灿然生光。女孩方当韶龄，不过十五六岁年纪，肌肤胜雪，娇美无比，笑面迎人，容色绝丽。
她突然长袖轻举，就在花树底下翩翩起舞。但见她转头时金环曜日，起臂处白衣凌风，到后来越舞越急，挥动衣袖，扶向身边花树，树上花瓣乱落，红花，白花，黄花，紫花，如一只只蝴蝶绕着她身子转动。她舞了一会，忽地纵起，跃到一株树上，随即跳到另一株树上，舞蹈中夹杂着 “逍遥游”与“桃花落英掌”的身法，想见喜悦已极。

没错这就是金庸笔下最经典的一对CP，靖哥哥和蓉儿，而这一桃花岛上的经典桥段也在我的脑海中曾经不断地上演，那时候我们还在用钢笔书写着纸短情长，还在买IC卡在宿舍的走廊里排队等着述说衷肠，还在骑着单车心心念念能在街边的书报亭租到想看的武侠小说。那时读金庸，真的是不眠不休，在那个和书中主人公相仿的年纪，快意恩仇，江湖天下，豪情岂止万丈，情窦初开，儿女情长，天涯思君不可忘。我很喜欢射雕英雄传，因为有大侠笔下最完美的郭靖和黄蓉。但也正因为对他们的完美塑造，让他们的形象很难用有形的方式展示，近乎是只可远观而不可亵玩了。83版的射雕被人奉为经典，但港剧对原著改动太多，虽也有精彩改编，但还是显得过于狗血，而这段金庸笔下精彩的描写，在剧中也只是镜头绕着两人转圈圈。周迅，李亚鹏版虽然剧情上挺忠于原著，但李亚鹏的呆傻，周迅的年纪，装扮和声音，简直离心中的蓉儿相差太远，而桃花岛这段在剧中就是一个只有几颗枯树的小山包，连转圈圈都没有。这么多年过去了，没想到这个MV竟然完美地呈现了心中的画面，便按图索翼才发现画面源于2017大陆版的新射雕英雄传，于是便追着看了下来，昨天收官不禁有感这一部良心之作，不但剧情很忠于原著（从不相信当今世上还有比大师更好的编剧），最主要是选角更加终于原著，靖蓉杨穆全都是二十出头的演员，初来乍到，犹如白纸一样没有知名演员的刻板形象，而且看他们的表演如同从书中走出一般自然生动（猜想他们应该都熟读并揣摩过原著的人物），不禁大呼过瘾。近些年影视圈一直在批判小鲜肉，但这部剧中的小鲜肉们用扎实的表演在诠释着江山代有人才出，郭靖也曾经小鲜肉过但这并不妨碍他变成了人人敬仰的大侠。
当下无奈的现实对比这美好的回忆，真是羡慕黄药师那魏晋风骨和放荡不羁。桃花影落飞神剑，碧海潮声按玉箫，江湖虽然随着大师的仙逝而远去，但一群青葱少年用荧幕还原了那些最宝贵的经典。

郭靖忽然想起，说道：“我给你带了点心来。”从怀里掏出完颜康送来的细点，可是他背负王处一、换水化毒、奔波求药，早把点心压得或扁或烂，不成模样。黄蓉看了点心的样子，轻轻一笑。郭靖红了脸，道：“吃不得了！”拿起来要抛入湖中。黄蓉伸手接过，道：“我爱吃。”
郭靖一怔，黄蓉已把一块点心放在口里吃起来。郭靖见她吃了几口，眼圈渐红，眼眶中慢慢涌上泪水，更是不解。黄蓉道：“我生下来就没了妈，从来没哪个像你这样记着我过……”说着几颗泪水流了下来。她取出一块洁白手帕，郭靖以为她要擦拭泪水，哪知她把几块压烂了的点心细心包起，放在怀里，回眸一笑，道：“我慢慢的吃。”

郭靖道：“嗯。我要牵着你的手，对六位师父与马道长他们说道：蓉儿是好姑娘，不是妖女，我……我不能没有她……”一面说，一面拉着黄蓉的小手，昂起了头，斩钉截铁般说着，似乎柯镇恶、马钰等就在他眼前：“师父对我恩重如山，弟子粉身难报，但是，但是，蓉儿……蓉儿可不是小妖女，她是很好很好的姑娘……很好很好的……”他心中有无数言辞要为黄蓉辩护，但话到口头，却除了说她“很好很好”之外，更无别语。

During this period of time, due to the pandemic, I've been working from home, and the home office is quite different from the solemnity of a corporate setting. When there are no meetings, there's always some soft background music playing. Listening to it repeatedly, various AI platforms behind the scenes work tirelessly for you. One day, YouTube recommended a song called 'Taoyuan Three Lives.' At first, I didn't pay much attention to it, even though it was a beautiful Chinese-style song. However, unintentionally, I glanced at the MV (music video) screen, and it was an astonishing sight, like a sudden lightning strike that hit my heart and awakened the martial world that had been sealed in my heart for many years. It vividly reappeared before my eyes, making it difficult for me to distinguish whether it was real or an illusion.

In the video, there was a young girl dressed in white, with a golden ribbon tied to her hair, shining brightly in the sunlight. The girl seemed to be in her early teens, around fifteen or sixteen years old, with skin fairer than snow and incredibly beautiful, her smiling face exuding an unmatched charm. Suddenly, she gracefully raised her long sleeves and danced lightly under the flowering trees. When she turned her head, the golden ring on her hair shone like the sun, and her white clothes fluttered in the wind as she danced faster and faster. With a wave of her sleeves, flower petals fell from the trees around her - red, white, yellow, and purple flowers swirling around her like butterflies.

After a while, she leaped onto one tree, then another, showcasing the footwork of 'Free and Easy Wanderer' and the 'Peach Blossom Falling Palm.' Her joy was evident in her dance.

Indeed, this is the most classic couple, Jing Gege and Rong'er, portrayed by Jin Yong (a renowned Chinese novelist). Those classic scenes on Peach Blossom Island kept replaying in my mind. Back then, we used fountain pens to write long letters on paper, queued up in dormitory corridors to pour out our feelings using IC cards, and rode bicycles with a longing to rent the martial arts novels we wanted to read from the street newsstands. Reading Jin Yong's works at that time was truly an immersive experience. In those years, just like the protagonists in his books, we experienced the pleasures of seeking justice, roaming the rivers and lakes, and a boundless passion. Our hearts were filled with the feelings of youth, love, and unforgettable longing for distant places.

I loved 'The Legend of the Condor Heroes' because it had the most perfect portrayal of Guo Jing and Huang Rong, the great characters of wuxia fiction. However, their perfection in the novel made it challenging to represent them tangibly, almost like they were meant to be admired from a distance and not to be tampered with. The 1983 version of the series was considered a classic, but the Hong Kong adaptation deviated too much from the original work and, despite some exciting changes, appeared excessively melodramatic. Even in this remarkable description by Jin Yong, the TV series only circled around the two characters. Though the 2017 Mainland China version of the series remained faithful to the original novel, the portrayals by Li Yapeng and Zhou Xun seemed too far from my mental image of Huang Rong, given their appearances, age, attire, and voices. Additionally, the Peach Blossom Island scene in the series was nothing more than a small hill with a few withered trees, without any proper representation.

Over the years, I never expected an MV (music video) to perfectly present the image I had in mind. It was only after searching for its source that I discovered it originated from the 2017 Mainland China version of 'The Legend of the Condor Heroes.' Intrigued, I decided to watch it and found myself emotionally connected to this conscientious adaptation. Not only did it remain true to the original work (as I never believed there could be better screenwriters than the master himself), but the most crucial aspect was the casting, which finally stayed true to the novel. Guo Jing, Huang Rong, Yang Kang, and Mu Nianci were all portrayed by actors in their early twenties, newcomers without the baggage of well-known actors' fixed images. Their performances seemed as if they had walked out of the book, so natural and vivid (I speculated that they must have carefully studied and internalized the original characters). It was genuinely satisfying.

In recent years, the entertainment industry has been critical of "fresh meat" (referring to young and inexperienced actors). However, in this series, these young actors showcased talent and solid performances, demonstrating that the world would continue to produce capable individuals. Guo Jing, too, started as a "fresh meat," but that didn't stop him from becoming a revered hero admired by all.

In comparison to these beautiful memories, the helplessness of the current reality is truly envy-inducing. I long for Huang Yaoshi's character, with his elegance and unrestrained spirit from the Wei and Jin dynasties. The shadows of peach blossoms fall as the divine sword soars, and the sound of the emerald sea accompanies the jade flute. Although the rivers and lakes have drifted away with the passing of the masters, a group of youthful individuals has brought back those most precious classics on the screen.

Guo Jing suddenly remembered and said, "I brought some snacks for you." He took out the delicate pastries that Yang Kang had sent, but due to his carrying Wang Chongyang, searching for antidotes, and rushing around for medicines, the pastries were now squashed and in a sorry state. Huang Rong looked at the pastries and smiled lightly. Guo Jing blushed and said, "They are not edible!" He picked them up to throw them into the lake. Huang Rong reached out and took them, saying, "I love eating them."

Guo Jing was taken aback, but Huang Rong had already put a piece of pastry into her mouth and started eating. As Guo Jing watched her take a few bites, his eyes gradually turned red, and tears welled up in his eyes, feeling puzzled. Huang Rong said, "I lost my mother at birth, and no one has ever cared for me like you do..." Her words were interrupted by tears streaming down her face. She took out a clean handkerchief, and Guo Jing thought she would wipe away her tears, but instead, she carefully wrapped the squashed pastries and put them in her pocket. She turned around with a smile and said, "I'll eat them slowly."

Guo Jing said, "Hmm. I want to hold your hand and tell the six masters and Senior Ma: Rong'er is a good girl, not a demoness. I... I can't be without her..." As he spoke, he held Huang Rong's small hand and lifted his head, speaking with determination, as if Ke Zhen'e and Ma Yu were right in front of him. "My masters have shown me great kindness, and I am indebted to them, but Rong'er... Rong'er is not a wicked girl. She is a very, very good girl... very, very good..." In his heart, he had countless words to defend Huang Rong, but when it came to his lips, apart from saying that she was "very, very good," he could find no other words to express himself.
