重读倚天屠龙记，不同于三联版，新修版增加了很多细节，结局也有大改。倚天屠龙记是射雕三部曲的最后一部，也是最波澜壮阔，荡气回肠的一部。江湖恩怨，家仇国恨，儿女情长无不彰显的曲折离奇，引人入胜。金大侠此时的人生经历和创作经历都达到了一个高峰。尤其是写作，在射雕和神雕之上，可以说是文笔日臻完美。文中经典对话的描写不胜枚举，很多被影视剧直接引用，被编剧增减一点，便显不足。
当故事曲终人散，一切尘埃落定之后，留在心中长久萦绕的还是逃不过一个情字。如果说神雕是大侠的情书，但情味最浓的其实还是倚天，大侠要么不写，写了就彻底开挂。书中每一段情感都直击人心，惊世骇俗。
郭襄 - 风陵渡口初相遇，一见杨过误终生。人人知道杨过误郭襄一生，可又有谁知，是何人误了武当开山鼻祖的百年。一对郭襄赠送的少林罗汉，他视为珍宝一生珍藏，而少室山与她初见的远桥，莲舟，岱岩，松溪，翠山，梨亭，声谷便是他的七个弟子的名字，并嘱咐武当弟子永不得罪峨眉。
张翠山和殷素素更是在一场冰火岛奇幻之旅中，天上地下，人间海底生死相随。
杨逍与纪晓芙的终身不娶和义无反顾成就了最石破天惊的三个字“杨不悔”。
杨不悔在与张无忌少年时西域寻父时经历了那么多，她甚至将“初吻”也给了无忌，但谁想到他们两从此再无任何感情瓜葛而不悔的“第一个糖人”却是母亲的未婚夫殷梨亭。
金花婆婆黛绮丝能肯放弃圣女之尊身败名裂也要嫁给韩千叶。
张无忌的四段感情使他成为大侠笔下除了武功最高外，也是感情纠葛最多的男主了。这里我只想谈他和赵敏。张无忌和周芷若都很真实，现实中很容易便可以找到像他们这样的人，可赵敏却是独一无二的。
射雕三部曲始于草原终于草原，时空跨越百年，大侠的创造也跨越二十年，不知是宏大的故事构思使然，还是像他所说有的时候人物和情节走向他也无法控制，只能任其发展。

想想郭靖和黄蓉，其实是同门之恋，虽也遭反对，但当师父洪七公亲自做媒，也就没了大障碍。毕竟他们同族同国，世界观也都是保家卫国。虽有华筝，但她也只是郭靖道义上的配偶，但在郭靖心里十分清楚黄蓉才是他命中的唯一。
杨过与小龙女师生之恋，略起波澜，毕竟大违于当时的礼教，但杨过狂傲，执拗，坚决，一生战斗为小龙女，他的性格让人为之感动用情至深也惋惜他身边其他的姑娘，陆无双，程英，公孙绿萼和郭襄，但他和小龙女一定会在一起。

但到了张无忌和赵敏，不读到最后都不知道，忌敏会不会在一起，而结局三次大改也都无法彻底化解这个谜局。最后大侠让他们两回到了蒙古，算是一种大格局的结局。他两能走到一起真是最惊世骇俗了。那句“如果我偏要勉强”不知感动了多少人。大侠写这种男主女主恋情也足见他的胸怀和格局，他的悲天悯人。也是他对民族关系，朝代兴替的思考，华筝时的蒙古所向披靡，她作为公主之尊下嫁郭靖，一生痴情于他却终于不得，只因郭靖的精忠报国，历史车轮无人可挡，但大侠并没有抛弃弱者，而是歌颂了为国为民的侠义英雄。赵敏时的蒙古，大势已去，江山摇摇欲坠。而此时的张无忌又是抗元义军领袖，身边又有优点和特点特别鲜明的周芷若，小昭，殷离，而张无忌又是性格极为被动犹豫，但她最终还是能赢得他的真心，甘心退位与她共赴蒙古，不得不说是大侠的人文关怀，朝代兴替，亘古不变，万不足惜，但民族融合却是大势所趋。华筝虽令人惋惜，但作为强者却不会让人感动，赵敏就不一样了，虽然最后失去了家国，但人人为之动容，大侠笔下美女众多，但赵敏永远是那颗最耀眼，最璀璨的，在我心中亦是如此！

Rereading "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber," the new revised edition differs from the three-part joint edition as it includes many additional details and significant changes to the ending. "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber" is the final part of "The Condor Trilogy" and is also the most epic and gripping work. It weaves together the enmities of the martial world, familial vendettas, and national hatred, with intricate and fascinating twists that captivate readers.

During this period, Jin Yong (the pen name of the author) reached the pinnacle of his life experiences and creative endeavors. Especially in terms of his writing, he achieved near-perfection compared to his previous works, "The Legend of the Condor Heroes" and "The Return of the Condor Heroes." The depiction of classic dialogues in the book is countless, and many lines have been directly quoted in film and television adaptations. However, even slight modifications can make them lose some of their perfection.

When the story comes to an end, and everything settles down, what lingers in the heart for a long time is the inescapable emotion. If "The Return of the Condor Heroes" is considered a romantic novel of chivalry, then the one with the strongest emotional resonance is undoubtedly "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber." When it comes to depicting emotions, Jin Yong didn't hold back at all - he went all out.

In this book, every emotional segment strikes directly at the heart, astonishing and astounding readers with its depth and complexity.

"Guo Xiang - At the ferry crossing of Fengling, they first met, and Yang Guo's first sight led to a lifetime of affection. Everyone knows that Yang Guo influenced Guo Xiang's entire life, but who knows who caused a hundred years of misunderstanding for Wudang's founding ancestor. The Luohan statues gifted by Guo Xiang, he treasured throughout his life. The names of his seven disciples are related to Shaoshi Mountain, Yuanqiao Bridge, Lianzhou, Daiyan, Songxi, Cuishan, and Liteing. He also instructed the Wudang disciples never to offend Emei."

Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu, during a fantastic journey to the Ice-Fire Island, accompanied each other through life and death in the sky, on the earth, and even under the sea.

The lifelong commitment and unwavering devotion of Yang Xiao and Ji Xiaofu resulted in the most astonishing three words, 'Yang Bu Hui' (Yang is not remorseful).

When Yang Bu Hui was a youth, she experienced so much alongside Zhang Wuji while searching for her father in the Western Regions. She even gave her 'first kiss' to Wuji, but who would have thought that they would have no further emotional connection from then on. Surprisingly, her 'first sugar figure' (an endearing term for a crush) was actually her mother's fiancé, Yin Liting.

Jinhua Granny Dai Qisi was willing to give up her status as the Holy Maiden, disregarding personal reputation and dignity, just to marry Han Qianye.

Zhang Wuji's four romantic entanglements made him the most emotionally complex protagonist in the world of chivalry, surpassing others not only in martial arts prowess but also in romantic involvements. Here, I only want to focus on his relationship with Zhao Min. Both Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo are relatable characters, easily resembling real people, but Zhao Min is truly one of a kind.

The Condor Trilogy begins on the grasslands and ends on the grasslands, spanning a hundred years and taking over twenty years to create these epic tales of chivalry. It's unclear whether it's the grand design of the story or, as he once said, sometimes the characters and plot take on a life of their own, beyond the author's control, and he can only let them develop freely.

Thinking about Guo Jing and Huang Rong, theirs is actually a romance within the same sect. Although they faced opposition, when their master, Hong Qigong, personally acted as a matchmaker, the major obstacle was removed. After all, they belong to the same ethnicity and nation, sharing a worldview of protecting their homeland. Despite Hua Zheng being present, she is only Guo Jing's spouse in terms of righteousness, but deep down, Guo Jing knows that Huang Rong is his destined one.

As for Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, their teacher-student romance caused some ripples, as it went against the prevailing social norms of that time. However, Yang Guo's arrogance, persistence, and unwavering devotion in his lifelong battle for Xiaolongnü moved people deeply. Despite his deep affection and regrets for the other girls around him - Lu Wushuang, Cheng Ying, Gong Sun Lü'e, and Guo Xiang - he and Xiaolongnü are destined to be together.

But when it comes to Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min, one wouldn't know if they will end up together until the very end. Even with three major changes to the ending, the mystery remains unresolved. Ultimately, the great heroes sent them both back to Mongolia, which can be considered a resolution on a grand scale. Their union is truly astonishing and defies common conventions. The line 'If I insist on forcing it' has touched the hearts of countless people.

Jin Yong's portrayal of the romance between the male and female protagonists reveals his broad-mindedness and vision, as well as his compassion for humanity. It also reflects his contemplation on ethnic relations and the rise and fall of dynasties. During Hua Zheng's time in Mongolia, they were invincible, yet she chose to marry Guo Jing and remained devoted to him throughout her life. However, fate did not allow their love to flourish due to Guo Jing's unwavering loyalty to his country. The unstoppable wheel of history rolled on, but the great hero did not abandon the weak; instead, he celebrated the chivalrous heroes who fought for their country and people.

In Zhao Min's era of Mongolia, the empire was declining, and the nation was on the brink of collapse. At this time, Zhang Wuji was a leader of the anti-Yuan rebellion, with Zhou Zhiruo, Xiaozhao, and Yin Li by his side, each with their own distinctive traits. Zhang Wuji's character was extremely passive and hesitant, but in the end, he was won over by Zhao Min's sincerity. He willingly stepped down from his leadership role to go with her to Mongolia. This showcases the great hero's concern for humanity and the changing tides of dynasties. Throughout history, some things remain constant and inexorable, yet the integration of different ethnic groups is an inevitable trend.

Although Hua Zheng's fate is regrettable, as a strong character, she might not evoke the same sense of empathy as Zhao Min does. Despite losing her homeland in the end, Zhao Min touches the hearts of everyone. Jin Yong's works feature many beautiful women, but Zhao Min will forever shine as the brightest and most brilliant among them. In my heart, she will always be so!
